"[Software Features]\n"
"This software automatically matches and generates Pitch Deviation expression "
"parameters in the corresponding track of an OpenUtau project file, based on "
"the reference vocal audio provided by the user. The software does not modify "
"your original OpenUtau project file.\n"
"\n"
"[Usage Steps]\n"
"1. Select a song to be covered by a virtual singer and use tools like UVR to "
"get the vocal track.\n"
"2. Create a singing track in OpenUtau with notes but without parameters. The "
"tempo and note lengths do not need to be an exact match to the original song—"
"just similar.\n"
"3. Input the following files into this software:\n"
"   - \"Reference Vocal Audio File\" (WAV format)\n"
"   - \"Exported Virtual Singer Vocal File from OpenUtau\" (WAV format)\n"
"   - \"OpenUtau Project File\" (USTX format)\n"
"4. Enter the track number for which you want to generate Pitch Deviation "
"expression parameters.\n"
"5. Click the \"Run\" button and wait for the progress bar to complete. The "
"current step will be displayed in the status bar below the progress bar.\n"
"6. The pitch extraction process takes a few minutes. Using an Nvidia GPU "
"(driver version >= 452.39) can significantly speed up the process. The "
"software has a caching mechanism, so if the same audio file is processed "
"again, it will use the cached data.\n"
"7. Once completed, maximize the software window to view the pitch curve on "
"the right side. The OpenUtau project file with Pitch Deviation expression "
"parameters will be saved next to your original project file.\n"
